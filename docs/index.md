The Privatemode API provides an end-to-end encrypted, privacy-first GenAI service with functionality similar to ChatGPT, but with one crucial difference: your data stays private. Not even we, as the service provider, have access to your data—it’s inaccessible to anyone but you. This is made possible through confidential computing, a state-of-the-art security technology that enforces data confidentiality at all times.

Even with this robust security, the Privatemode API is easy to use. You can integrate it like any other GenAI API.
