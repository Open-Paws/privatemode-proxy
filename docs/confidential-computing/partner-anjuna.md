## Anjuna Confidential Computing Platform

Anjuna Confidential Computing Platform is a breakthrough software solution. It allows you to run applications on [Azure confidential computing](../overview) instances powered by [AMD SEV-SNP](../confidential-vm-overview) or by [Intel SGX](../application-development) CPUs with enhanced ease of use, operational efficiency and security posture. Anjuna seamlessly integrates with Azure confidential computing instances creating a protected execution environment that intrinsically secures applications. With Anjuna, data is kept secure because itâs encrypted â in use, in transit and at restâ and kept private because itâs isolated from anyone with access to the infrastructure. Through built-in cryptographic attestation, Anjuna empowers enterprises to directly control application-level trust policies, ensuring that only trusted code can access sensitive data.

The result is a revolutionary approach that brings security directly into compute, eliminating exposure to a wide range of threats from insiders, third parties, malicious software and more.
