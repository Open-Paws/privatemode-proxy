# Privatemode API

Version: 1.30

On this page

Privatemode supports APIs that are mostly compatible with the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference).
We like to highlight that we don't use any OpenAI services but only follow their interface definitions.
For sending prompts, simply use the [Privatemode proxy](/guides/proxy-configuration) as your endpoint. It'll take care of end-to-end encryption with our GenAI services for you.
For more information on the Privatemode proxy see the [architecture documentation](/architecture/client-side#privatemode-proxy) and the [configuration guide](/guides/proxy-configuration).
